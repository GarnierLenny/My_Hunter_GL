Duck Hunt like game made with love and CSFML

This is My_Hunter_GL repository.
It consists of a Duck Hunt like game.
To make it work you'll need CSFML package installed.
Once you Have CSFML installed and cloned this repository you must type "make" on the terminal and execute the generated binary "my_hunter" by typing: "./my_hunter"
Once the game is launched moles will appear on the screen, shoot them by pressing mouse left click.
After running out of lives you'll be able to see the scoreboard.
You can enter your player name in the "player_name" file in src/score/.
This project isn't finished so I plan to work on it, I'll keep you updated.

Thanks for playing and do not hesitate to give feedback or/and rate my project !
